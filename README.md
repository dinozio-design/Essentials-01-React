Simply open the code in your favourite code editor or IDE, and follow these steps:

2. Once the packages are successully installed, then type in the terminal `npm run dev` which will start the developent server
3. open your favourite browser and go to `http://localhost:5173/` where you can review the final product and its interactibility in your local environment. 
4. In order to close the development server go to your terminal and use the short key `Ctrl C`.
